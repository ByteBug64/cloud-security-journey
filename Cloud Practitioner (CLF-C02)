Cloud Foundations Portfolio 
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)
Course: Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)
Instructor: Stephane Maarek
Platform: Udemy
Status: ✅ Completed (January 2026)
Focus: AWS Fundamentals, Cloud Security, and Cloud Architecture

1.Summary
This document serves as a technical portfolio for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) certification. 
It demonstrates a strong foundational understanding of the AWS Cloud ecosystem, with a learning focus intentionally 
aligned toward an eventual specialization in Cloud Security Engineering.The coursework covered AWS global infrastructure, 
the Shared Responsibility Model, and core AWS services required to design secure, scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant cloud solutions.

2. Hands-On Projects
Applied knowledge demonstrating practical cloud and security skills.
Project 1: Secure S3 Static Website
Objective:
Deploy a cost-effective and highly available static website using Amazon S3 while enforcing strong security controls.
Architecture:
Configured an Amazon S3 bucket for static website hosting
Used AWS-managed infrastructure to eliminate server management overhead
Security Implementation
Disabled Block Public Access only at the bucket policy level
Maintained account-level public access protections
Implemented a custom JSON bucket policy allowing GetObject access strictly for public website content
Outcome:
Successfully hosted a live static website endpoint with low latency, minimal cost, and zero server administration.

3. Core Competencies and Technical Deep Dive
A. Identity and Access Management (IAM) & Security
Focus: Secure access control – the “front door” to AWS.
Managed IAM Users, Groups, and Roles
Enforced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on root and IAM users
Applied the Principle of Least Privilege using JSON policies
Distinguished IAM Access Keys (CLI/API access) from console credentials
Implemented password rotation and complexity policies for compliance

B. AWS Compute Services
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Understanding instance families:
General Purpose (T3, M5)
Compute Optimized (C5)
Memory Optimized (R5)
Used EC2 User Data to bootstrap instances with shell scripts
Configured Security Groups to allow SSH (Port 22) and HTTP (Port 80) traffic
High Availability & Scalability
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for traffic distribution
Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) for dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization
Serverless & Containers
AWS Lambda for event-driven, serverless execution
Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate for containerized workloads (Docker fundamentals)

C. Storage and Databases
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Knowledge of storage classes:
S3 Standard
S3 Intelligent-Tiering
S3 Standard-IA
Amazon Glacier for archival storage
Enabled versioning to protect against accidental deletion
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Attached persistent block storage to EC2 instances
Created snapshots for backup and disaster recovery
Databases
Amazon RDS for managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB)
Amazon DynamoDB for high-performance NoSQL key-value workloads

D. Networking and Content Delivery
Designed networks using Amazon VPC
Implemented Public and Private Subnets
Used NAT Gateways for secure outbound internet access from private subnets
Managed DNS using Amazon Route 53 (Simple, Weighted, Failover routing)
Leveraged Amazon CloudFront CDN to reduce latency for global users

E. Cloud Security, Compliance, and Governance
Shared Responsibility Model
AWS: Security of the cloud (physical infrastructure)
Customer: Security in the cloud (data, IAM, OS, configurations)
DDoS Protection
AWS Shield Standard (automatic protection)
AWS Shield Advanced (enhanced protection for critical workloads)
Compliance & Encryption
Used AWS Artifact to access compliance reports (ISO, PCI-DSS)
Understood AWS KMS for encryption at rest and in transit

4. Operational Excellence and Billing
AWS CloudTrail for auditing and governance (“who did what and when”)
Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring metrics and setting alarms
AWS Budgets to prevent unexpected spending
AWS Cost Explorer to analyze usage and optimize costs

5. Future Roadmap
AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)
