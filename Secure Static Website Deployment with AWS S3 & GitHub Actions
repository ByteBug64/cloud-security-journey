📦 Secure Static Website Deployment with AWS S3 & GitHub Actions
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website to Amazon S3 using GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
The goal is to automate deployment while applying AWS security best practices at a Cloud Practitioner level.

🎯 Project Objectives

Automate static website deployment using GitHub Actions

Use AWS IAM with least-privilege access

Understand real-world AWS ↔ GitHub integration

Practice secure cloud deployment fundamentals

🛠️ Technologies Used

GitHub Actions – CI/CD automation

Amazon S3 – Static website hosting

AWS IAM – Access control and permissions

AWS CLI – Deployment via aws s3 sync

🏗️ Architecture (Simple)
Developer → GitHub → GitHub Actions → AWS S3


Code is pushed to GitHub

GitHub Actions runs automatically

Files are synced to an S3 bucket

⚙️ Deployment Workflow

Push code to the main branch

GitHub Actions workflow triggers

AWS credentials are loaded from GitHub Secrets

Website files are synced to S3 using:

aws s3 sync . s3://<bucket-name>

🔐 Security Considerations

AWS credentials stored securely using GitHub Secrets

IAM user configured with least-privilege policy

No hardcoded AWS credentials in the repository

Access keys rotated after exposure detection

🚀 Outcome

Successfully deployed a static website to AWS S3

Implemented CI/CD using GitHub Actions

Gained hands-on experience debugging real AWS IAM and S3 permission issues

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Cloud fundamentals (AWS)

IAM permissions & security

CI/CD pipelines

Troubleshooting cloud deployment errors


🔧 Challenges & Debugging (GitHub ↔ AWS)

During this project, I encountered multiple issues while integrating GitHub Actions with Amazon S3 for automated deployment. 
Below are the key problems and how they were resolved.

1️⃣ GitHub Actions – AWS Credentials Not Loading

Error:

Credentials could not be loaded from any providers


Cause:

AWS credentials were:

Misformatted in GitHub Secrets, or

Previously exposed and automatically quarantined by AWS

Resolution:

Created a new IAM access key

Stored credentials correctly in GitHub Repository Secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

Removed the compromised key

2️⃣ S3 AccessDenied (ListObjectsV2)

Error:

AccessDenied: not authorized to perform s3:ListBucket


Cause:

IAM user lacked proper S3 permissions

Bucket name in the IAM policy did not match the actual S3 bucket

Resolution:

Attached a least-privilege IAM policy allowing:

s3:ListBucket

s3:GetObject

s3:PutObject

s3:DeleteObject

Ensured the policy referenced the exact bucket name

📘 Key Lessons Learned

IAM explicit deny overrides allow

GitHub Secrets must use the NAME = VALUE format

Least-privilege IAM policies are critical for secure deployments

Small misconfigurations can break CI/CD pipelines
